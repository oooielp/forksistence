The Threshold is a region of space which was previously inaccessible because of anamalous physical properties that isolated it from the rest of the galaxy.
Nanotrasen has worked with the Earth-based Solar Legion and the Vox to develop new technology that has allowed them to send colonists into the Threshold.

You are one such colonist.
