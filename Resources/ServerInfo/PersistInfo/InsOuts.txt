The Threshold is hard to enter but impossible to leave.
If you fly a ship far in any direction you will eventually hit the barrier and be pushed back towards the center.
Until the colonists of the Threshold can find a way to expand or disable the barrier they are trapped in a bubble of space.
When you need to sleep return to the cryo chamber you first arrived from and you can safely rest in cryo storage.
