As a colonist in the Threshold you are cant be forced to only work for Nanotrasen or the Solar Legion.

The trade stations are too far apart for a single organization to operate them all effectively and so faction-creation devices have been distributed to the Threshold.
Factions can be created to organize colonists into groups which range from small businesses and shuttle crews to large organizations that can operate full sized space stations.
Colonists are free to associate and work with multiple factions.
