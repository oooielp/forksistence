  # Threshold Science and Manufacturing
  This guide will explain how science and manufacturing are different in the Threshold.

  ## Science
  Our methods of collecting scientific data are very similar to other parts of the universe but the Threshold has some unique properties.
  The quantum nature of reality here means that when we research a technology we only get a limited amount of prints from our lathes before the research results become useless.
  As a result of these research consoles in the Threshold have been configured to allow the same technologies to be researched again and again to grant more prints out of a lathe.
  We work endlessly to try to understand this enigmatic region of space but the Threshold endlessly eludes us..

  ## Manufacturing
  Research machines must be connected to a faction to function correctly, but even a small faction can engage in research or manufacturing.
  Machine boards for nearly any machine can be made from a circuit imprinter, inclduing a machine board for a circuit imprinter.
  If you cant find a Threshold science department that is willing to sell you these machine boards you can import them through one of the trade stations.
  Being able to manufacture your own machines is key for a faction which wants to be independent in the Threshold.
