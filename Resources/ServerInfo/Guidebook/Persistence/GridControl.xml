  # Grid Control
  This guide will explain how to control grids in The Threshold. Whoever controls a grid has access control over any of the machines of that grid.

  ## Claiming a Grid
  With a grid configurator you can attempt to claim a grid.
  Grids can be claimed by individuals or factions and both have a limit to the amount of tiles they can control and they can purchase upgrades to increase.
  In order to claim a grid for a faction you must either be a faction owner or have an assignment with the CLAIM core function.


  ## Controling Your Grid
  Any grid can be unclaimed by any grid configurator unless it has one or more active grid control computers built on it.
  Building at least one grid control computer is crucial to preventing your grid from being hijacked.
  Grid control computers can be destroyed or switched off so they must be secured.

  ## Anchor Key
  Small grids can be parked safely in a deep-space pocket of The Threshold. An anchor key can be used to reserve space for the grid in deep-space and initiate the FTL process.
  Sentient passengers will be ejected before a grid parks in deep space as sentient creatures cannot survive FTL in the Threshold.

  Once a grid is parked the same anchor key that parked it can be used to retrieve it from deep space.
  Only the anchor key that parked a grid can be used to retrieve it and if the key is lost the grid is lost forever.

  Anchor keys can be used to protect grids from bandits while you sleep in cryo.
