  # Death and What Comes Next
  This guide will explain death in The Threshold and what you can do about it.

  ## Why Not Die?
  Survival is incredibly imporant in the Threshold! Cloning is rare in the Threshold and many people who die will never be recovered.
  Once a consciousness has moved on the body it leaves behind is brain-dead and beyond recovery. Any time you die you risk being lost forever.
  Don't die!

  ## I'm Dead, What Do I Do?
  When you die in the Threshold an implant we have given you will trap your consciousness right on the edge of oblivion. Don't worry, it doesn't hurt!
  Remaining in this semi-dead state will prevent your body from rotting. Even if you remain dead for weeks or months you can still be revived by a trained Threshold doctor.

  However, as a safety measure to prevent you from being trapped eternally in a state between life and death you will be able to trigger a failsafe and release your consciousness.
  Once you do that you'll be dead forever with no chance of recovery. You are strongly advised to wait for rescue for as long as you can.
