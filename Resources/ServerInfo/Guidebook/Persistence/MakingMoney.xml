  # Making Money
  This guide will explain many of the ways to make money in The Threshold.

  ## Get a Job
  You can get a job with a ship crew or at a space station and recieve a wage every twenty minutes.
  Finding a job in The Threshold is very easy and you have probably arrived very close to a hiring desk.

  ## Complete Cargo Bounties and Export Valuables
  In the Threshold cargo bounties are usually free for any individual or organization to complete. Find a cargo bounty terminal to start printing manifests.

  If you can reach a trade station you can sell goods and complete bounties for cash and if you belong to a faction you can directly deposit the funds into the faction account.

  ## Provide Goods and Services to other people.

  An invoice printer can be used to create digital invoices that other people can use to easily pay you money in exchange for a service or good.
  You can get filthy rich by selling valuable goods and services to your fellow Threshold residents.

  ## Start a Faction and Sieze a Trade Station

  Factions can be created in the Threshold which allow you to organize assignments, accesses and wages and assign them to faction members.
  When a faction reaches level three it grows mighty enough to sieze a trade station.
  
  The faction in control of a trade station can set taxes on imports and exports from that trade station.
  As consecutive bounties are completed your trade station will level up. A level 1 trade station charges the faction $5000 every time bounties respawn.
  A level 3 trade station pays a $10000 reward every time bounties respawn.
  Controlling a trade station is the best way to gain power and wealth in the Threshold.
