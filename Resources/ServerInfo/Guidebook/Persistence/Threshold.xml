  # Threshold
  This guide will explain the Threshold, the region of space where you currently are.

  ## The Basics
  The Threshold is a region of space which was previously inaccessible because of anamalous physical properties that isolated it from the rest of the galaxy.
  Nanotrasen has worked with the Earth-based Solar Legion and the Vox to develop new technology that has allowed them to send colonists into the Threshold.

  You are one such colonist.

  ## The ins and outs
  The Threshold is hard to enter but impossible to leave.
  If you fly a ship far in any direction you will eventually hit the barrier and be pushed back towards the center.
  Until the colonists of the Threshold can find a way to expand or disable the barrier they are trapped in a bubble of space.
  When you need to sleep return to the cryo chamber you first arrived from and you can safely rest in cryo storage.

  No emergency shuttle is coming any time soon. You need to find a way to live here with the other colonists while keeping enough power, air, food and water for everyone to survive.

  ## Independence and Interdependence
  As a colonist in the Threshold you are cant be forced to only work for Nanotrasen or the Solar Legion.

  The trade stations are too far apart for a single organization to operate them all effectively and so faction-creation devices have been distributed to the Threshold.
  Factions can be created to organize colonists into groups which range from small businesses and shuttle crews to large organizations that can operate full sized space stations.
  Colonists are free to associate and work with multiple factions.
