  # Threshold Mining/Hunting
  This guide will explain the unique dangers of Threshold mining and the rewards that come from confronting the deadly creatures.

  ## Mining
  The Threshold is rich with a variety of asteroid fields. These asteroid fields are infested with a variety of aggressive creatures that can survive in the void of space.
  These void-creatures can move through space as freely as a fish in water and will pursue you relentlessly if they catch your scent.
  Anyone intending to mine must practice extreme caution

  ### Gas Mining
  Asteroids often have gasses trapped inside them.
  Gas mining units can be installed to extract the gas and pipe it to a transfer node where it can be sent to a storage tank on board a mining vessel.
  
  ### Hunting
  The creatures found in asteroid fields will often have trophies that can be collected by butchering their corpses.
  Certain trade stations offer bounties for these trophies.
