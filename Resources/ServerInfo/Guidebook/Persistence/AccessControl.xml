  # Access Control
  This guide will explain how access works in The Threshold. Access is what restricts locked doors, crates, lockers and machines.
  The access configurator is the central tool to setting up access.

  ## Faction Access
  In the Threshold access must be either personal or factional.
  Every faction has an opportunity to create and manage their own accesses and a machine which is connected to a faction will choose from those accesses.
  The accesses your ID provides with a faction is determined by the assignment you have with that faction.

  ## Personal Access
  Machines in the Threshold also have the opportunity to use personal access. Personal access is a list of names which can access the machine.
  Any ID with a name that matches an entry in the Personal Access list will be allowed access.
