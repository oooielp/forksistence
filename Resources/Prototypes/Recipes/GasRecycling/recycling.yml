# Gas Recycling Recipes
# These recipes define how gases can be recycled through a gas recycler.
# Each recipe specifies:
# - inputGas: The waste gas to be recycled
# - outputGas: The useful gas produced
# - conversionRatio: The ratio of input to output (1.0 = 1:1 conversion)
# - minTemp: Minimum temperature (in K) required for recycling
# - minPressure: Minimum pressure (in kPa) required for recycling
# - scrubbedReagents: (Optional) Reagents that can be scrubbed from the gas into containers
